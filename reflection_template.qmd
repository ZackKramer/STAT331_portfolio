[**My Grade:**]{.underline} I believe my grade equivalent to course work evidenced below to be an A.

[**Learning Objective Evidence:**]{.underline} In the code chunks below, provide code from Lab or Challenge assignments where you believe you have demonstrated proficiency with the specified learning target. Be sure to specify **where** the code came from (e.g., Lab 4 Question 2).

## Working with Data

**WD-1: I can import data from a *variety* of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt, etc.).**

-   `csv`: Lab 3 Question 2

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-csv

evals = read_csv(file = here::here("data","teacher_evals.csv"),show_col_types = FALSE)

```

-   `xlsx`: PA 4 Question 1

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-xlsx

military <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", 
                                 "gov_spending_per_capita.xlsx"), 
                      sheet = "Share of Govt. spending", 
                      skip  = 7, 
                      n_max = 191)
```

-   `txt`: Check-in 2.3

```{r}
#| label: wd-1-txt

ages_mystery <- read_delim(file = here::here("Week 2", "Check-ins", "Ages_Data", "ages_mystery.txt"), delim = "|")
```

**WD-2: I can select necessary columns from a dataset.**

-   Challenge 3 Question 1

```{r}
#| label: wd-2

teacher_evals_compare <- evals |>
  filter(question_no == 903) |>
  mutate(SET_level = if_else(SET_score_avg >=4, 
                             "excellent",
                             "standard"),
         SEN_level = if_else(seniority <= 4,
                             "junior",
                             "senior")) |>
  select(course_id,
         SET_level,
         SEN_level)
```

**WD-3: I can filter rows from a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric: Lab 3 Question 9

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-numeric

teacher_evals_clean |>
  group_by(teacher_id, course_id) |>
  count() |> # each row is a question, so counting all returns #questions asked.
  filter(n == 9) |> 
  dim()

```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**): Lab 5

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-string

  filter(address_street_name %in% c("Northwestern Dr",
                                    "Franklin Ave"),
         str_detect(name, pattern = "Annabel") | address_number == max(address_number, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  inner_join(interview,
            by = join_by(id == person_id))
```

-   factor: Lab 4 Question 5

(updated to use slice_min() instead of arrange() and slice_tail()

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-factor



```

-   date (example must use functions from **lubridate**): Lab 5

```{r}
#| label: wd-3-date

facebook_event_checkin |>
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |>
  filter(str_detect(event_name, 
                    pattern = "SQL Symphony Concert"),
         year(date) == 2017,
         person_id == 78881 | person_id == 90700 | person_id == 99716) |>
  inner_join(person, by = join_by(person_id == id))

```

**WD-4: I can modify existing variables and create new variables in a dataframe for a *variety* of data types (e.g., numeric, integer, character, factor, date).**

-   numeric (using `as.numeric()` is not sufficient): Lab 3 Question 8

```{r}
#| label: wd-4-numeric

teacher_evals_clean |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  summarize(distinct_vals = n_distinct(teacher_id)) |>
  mutate(distinct_vals / sum(distinct_vals) * 100)

```

-   character -- specifically a string (example must use functions from **stringr**): Lab 4 Question 6

```{r}

## Reproducibility

**R-1: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the here package.**

I've done this in the following provided assignments: Lab 5, Challenge 2

**R-2: I can write well documented and tidy code.**

       title = "Median Weekly Price for Center-Based Childcare for an Infant ($)") + 
  theme_bw() # Changed theme to BW to make points stand out more

```

-   Example of **dplyr** pipeline: Lab 3 Question 9

```{r}
#| label: r-2-2

teacher_evals_clean |>
  group_by(teacher_id, course_id) |>
  count() |> # each row is a question, so counting all returns #questions asked.
  filter(n == 9) |> 
  dim()
```

-   Example of function formatting: Lab 4 Question 7

```{r}
#| label: r-2-3

ggplot(data = ca_childcare, mapping = aes(x = mhi_2018,
                                          y = mc_infant)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

       y = "",
       title = "Median Weekly Price for Center-Based Childcare for an Infant ($)") + 
  theme_bw()
```

**R-3: I can write robust programs that are resistant to changes in inputs.**

-   Example -- any context: Lab 7 Question 4

```{r}
#| label: r-3-example

rescale_01 <- function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x) | length(x) <= 1) {
    stop("Error: Input vector must be numeric with a length not greater than 1.")
  }
  
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  return((x - rng[1]) / 
    (rng[2] - rng[1]))
  
}

```

-   Example of function stops: Challenge 7 Question 2

```{r}
#| label: r-3-function-stops

replace_unlikely_vals <- function(x, x_min, x_max){
  
  if (!is.numeric(x) | length(x) <= 1) {
    stop("Error: Input vector must be numeric with a length not greater than 1.")
  }
  
  case_when(
    x < x_min ~ NA,
    x > x_max ~ NA,
    .default = x
  )
  
}

## Data Visualization & Summarization

**DVS-1: I can create visualizations for a *variety* of variable types (e.g., numeric, character, factor, date)**

-   at least two numeric variables: Lab 4 Question 7

```{r}
#| label: dvs-1-num

ggplot(data = ca_childcare, mapping = aes(x = mhi_2018,
                                          y = mc_infant)) + 
  geom_point() +

       y = "",
       title = "Median Weekly Price for Center-Based Childcare for an Infant ($)") + 
  theme_bw()

  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Rodent Weight Distribution by Species",
       x = "Weight (g)",

  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=13)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "SET Level", values = c("#4e82b5", "#c88500"))

**DVS-4: I can calculate numerical summaries of variables.**

-   Example using `summarize()`: Lab 3 Question 6

```{r}
#| label: dvs-4-summarize

teacher_evals_clean |>
  summarize(across(.cols = course_id:teacher_id,
                   .fns = ~ n_distinct(.x)))

```

-   Example using `across()`: Lab 3 Question 6

```{r}

teacher_evals_clean |>
  summarize(across(.cols = course_id:teacher_id,
                   .fns = ~ n_distinct(.x)))
```

**DVS-5: I can find summaries of variables across multiple groups.**

-   Example 1: Lab 4 Question 4

```{r}
#| label: dvs-5-1

ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>

              names_prefix = "mhi_") |>
  arrange(desc(mhi_2018))

```

-   Example 2: Lab 3 Question 10

```{r}
#| label: dvs-5-2

teacher_evals_clean |>
  group_by(teacher_id) |>
  filter(question_no == "901") |>
  summarise(avg_rate = mean(SET_score_avg)) |>
  slice_max(order_by = avg_rate, n=1)
```

**DVS-6: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader.**

-   Example 1: Lab 4 Question 4

(updated column names from "mhi" to "median household income")

```{r}
#| label: dvs-6-1

ca_childcare |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>

              names_prefix = "median household income ") |>
  arrange(desc("median household income 2018"))

```

-   Example 2: Lab 3 Challenge 10

(added rename function)

```{r}
#| label: dvs-6-2

  slice_min(order_by = avg_rate, n=1) |>
  rename("Average Rating for Question 1" = avg_rate,
         "Teacher ID" = teacher_id)
```

**DVS-7: I show creativity in my tables.**

-   Example 1: Challenge 9 (Lab 9)

(updated Cambria to Calibri)

```{r}
#| label: dvs-7-1

enframe(results, 
        name = "simulation_number", 
        value = "ncorrect") |>
  count(ncorrect) |>
  mutate(proportion = n/10000) |>
  select("Number Returned Correctly" = ncorrect, "Proportion" = proportion) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Proportion of Simulations where Babies were Returned Correctly") |>

                         weight = "bold")), 
            locations = cells_title()) |>
  fmt_percent(columns =  Proportion)

```

-   Example 2: Challenge 9 (Lab 8)

```{r}
#| label: dvs-7-2

fish |>
  map_int(.f = ~ sum(is.na(.x))) |>
  bind_cols(Name = names(fish)) |>

## Data Simulation & Statisical Models

**DSSM-1: I can simulate data from a *variety* of probability models.**

-   Example 1: Lab 9 Question 1

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-1

randomBabies <- function(nBabies){
  baby_data <- tibble(baby = 1:nBabies,
                      returned = rbinom(n = nBabies, size = 1, prob = 1/nBabies))
  
  babies_found <- baby_data |>
    filter(returned == 1) |>
    nrow()
  
  return(babies_found)
}

results <- map_int(.x = 1:10000,
                   .f = ~ randomBabies(nBabies = 4)
                   )

```

-   Example 2: Lab 9 Question 4/5/6

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-2

simulate_means <- function(n, df){
  tibble(sim = 1:n,
         mean = map_dbl(.x = 1:n, 
          .f = ~rchisq(n = 100, df) %>% mean()
          ))
}

grid <- crossing(n = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000), 
                 df = 10)

all_simulations <- grid |> 
  mutate(simulated_means = pmap(.l = list(n, df), 
                                .f = simulate_means)
         ) |> 
  unnest(cols = simulated_means)

```

**DSSM-2: I can conduct common statistical analyses in R.**

-   Example 1: Lab 2 Question 17

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-1

species_mod <- aov(weight ~ species, data = surveys)

summary(species_mod)

```

-   Example 2: Lab 4 Question 8

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-2

reg_mod1 <- lm(data = ca_childcare, formula = mhi_2018 ~ mc_infant)
summary(reg_mod1)

```

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I've revised every "growing" question and several "success" questions up to Lab 4; most of them have been smaller mistakes, but I've tried to leave reflection comments for every revision that shows my understanding of why a revision was necessary:

![Lab 3 Grading](images/lab3_grading.png)

![Lab 3 Question 3 Revision](images/revision_reflection.png)

![Lab 3 Canvas Comment](images/revision_comment.png)

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I've tried to experiment more with adding more to my labs than just the information necessary to answer each question. For example, I've started adding code comments (Lab 2), which is something I've never ever done in any programming course before. 
I've also been experimenting with aesthetics (Lab 5) that makes the html document a bit more visually appealing than the default layout - something I've also never cared to do in any other programming course.
For the original lab 8, I had tried to style all my tables using kable() from the knitr package (for some reason it didn't work with Q4 and crashed when I tried to use it for the really big table from Q2). 

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

Discord feedback:

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

I was paired with Daniel for most of the pair programming activities, and I think we've learned to work well together. For the first activity it was a little slow and difficult to share the weight of the assignment (I find it easier to code alone), but we've discovered eachother's strengths and weaknesses and have been able to finish each activity pretty efficiently.
I paired up with Zhi He for the later activities and discovered that he's a much different collaborator, definitely someone that would rather work alone. I found that I had to be a bit more forward and faster with my ideas to be able to contribute effectively. By our last activity we had a good dynamic and finished really quickly.
