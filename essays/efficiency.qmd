As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Your essay should address the following questions:

-   What is the definition of “efficiency”?

-   What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

-   What does efficiency allow you to do?

-   Why is efficiency important?

-   Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some [“a-ha” moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

Efficiency is the ability to reach a desired output using the least amount of resources without sacrificing quality. In statistical computing / data science, efficiency involves optimizing code and/or workflows to minimize computation time and memory usage. One of the earlier moments in this course where I was able to make my code efficient was in Challenge 2, where I applied 14 annotations with one function call (seen in DVS-3).

Efficiency allows you to process large datasets quickly, iterate more frequently, and/or allocate resources to more complex tasks. Efficiency is important because it saves time and enables scalability, making it possible to handle larger datasets and deliver results faster in real-world applications. Writing functions is one of the keys to scalability, as it really decreases on the time needed to write large programs; those in PE-2 is where this is seen in my portfolio.
